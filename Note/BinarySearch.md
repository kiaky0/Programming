# Binary Search Note

### Code Explanation

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] nums, int key) {
    int l = 0, h = nums.length - 1;
    while (l <= h) {
        int m = l + (h - l) / 2;
        if (nums[m] == key) {
            return m;
        } else if (nums[m] > key) {
            h = m - 1;
        } else {
            l = m + 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Purpose of Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until youâ€™ve narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   ```java
   int l = 0, h = nums.length - 1;
   ```
   - `l` (low) is initialized to `0`, the beginning of the array.
   - `h` (high) is initialized to `nums.length - 1`, the end of the array.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   ```java
   while (l <= h) {
   ```
   - The loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `h`. This condition ensures that there are still elements to be checked.

3. **Calculate Midpoint:**
   ```java
   int m = l + (h - l) / 2;
   ```
   - `m` (mid) is calculated as the middle index between `l` and `h`.
   - This formula `l + (h - l) / 2` is used instead of `(l + h) / 2` to prevent potential overflow when `l` and `h` are large values.

4. **Check Midpoint Value:**
   ```java
   if (nums[m] == key) {
       return m;
   }
   ```
   - If the element at index `m` is equal to `key`, the search is successful, and the method returns `m`.

5. **Adjust Search Range:**
   ```java
   else if (nums[m] > key) {
       h = m - 1;
   }
   ```
   - If `nums[m]` is greater than `key`, it means `key` must be in the left half (lower indices) of the current range. Hence, `h` is adjusted to `m - 1`.

   ```java
   else {
       l = m + 1;
   }
   ```
   - If `nums[m]` is less than `key`, it means `key` must be in the right half (higher indices) of the current range. Hence, `l` is adjusted to `m + 1`.

6. **Key Not Found:**
   ```java
   return -1;
   ```
   - If the loop exits without finding the `key`, it means the `key` is not present in the array. The method returns `-1` to indicate this.

### Visualization with an Example

Let's consider an example to visualize how this code works:
- Input array `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`
- Key to find `key = 7`

**Initial State:**
- `l = 0`
- `h = 5`

**Iteration Steps:**

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `m = 0 + (5 - 0) / 2 = 2`
   - `nums[2] = 5`
   - Since `nums[2] < 7`, adjust `l` to `m + 1 = 3`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `l = 3`
   - `h = 5`
   - `m = 3 + (5 - 3) / 2 = 4`
   - `nums[4] = 9`
   - Since `nums[4] > 7`, adjust `h` to `m - 1 = 3`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `l = 3`
   - `h = 3`
   - `m = 3 + (3 - 3) / 2 = 3`
   - `nums[3] = 7`
   - Since `nums[3] == 7`, return `m = 3`.

### Summary

The `binarySearch` method efficiently finds the `key` in a sorted array `nums` by repeatedly dividing the search range in half. It adjusts the search range based on the comparison of the middle element with the `key`, ensuring logarithmic time complexity \(O(\log n)\). If the `key` is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns `-1` to indicate the `key` is not present in the array.
