# Greedy

保证每次操作都是局部最优的，并且最后得到的结果是全局最优的。

## Question 1 - 455. Assign Cookies

you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

```
Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

```java
public int findContentChildren(int[] grid, int[] size) {
    if (grid == null || size == null) return 0;
    Arrays.sort(grid);
    Arrays.sort(size);
    int gi = 0, si = 0;
    while (gi < grid.length && si < size.length) {
        if (grid[gi] <= size[si]) {
            gi++;
        }
        si++;
    }
    return gi;
}
```
