  <p>
    But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium she
    imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of tiny,
    delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene currents
    and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in any case. The
    ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an artificial environment.
    The ocean was a world. And a world is not art. Dorothy thought about the
    living things that moved in that world: large, ruthless and hungry. Like us
    up here.

As soon as the browser downloads the HTML, the browser will start to display the page.

Once the image is loaded, the browser adds the image to the page. Because the image takes up space, the browser has to move the text down the page, to fit the image above it:
